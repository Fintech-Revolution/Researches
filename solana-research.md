# Solana
[Solana](https://solana.com/) is a high-performance blockchain supporting builders around the world creating crypto apps that scale today. Solana is a decentralized blockchain built to enable scalable, user-friendly apps, Solana can process more transactions and charges much lower gass fees then Ethereum.

Solana is a proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain and also uses a new technology called Proof of History (PoH).

## What is Proof of History?
> This time problem gets pretty difficult in distributed systems. When you need to move fast and process transactions as soon as possible, you need to be able to time in small units. But many programmable blockchains, like Ethereum, rely on outside programs to assign a “median” timestamp — which they then use to validate transactions in the order they were received.

> But referring back to a centralized source defeats the purpose of a decentralized system. Solana solves this problem by using an innovative technology called Proof of History, which allows these “timestamps” to be built into the blockchain itself.

## Performance and fees
- Solana transaction fees are averaging $0.00025 per transaction.

- Solana can process 65,000 transactions per second.

## Is Solana scalable?
Solana ensures composability between ecosystem projects by maintaining a single global state as the network scales. Never deal with fragmented Layer 2 systems or sharded chains.

According to (Rodrigues, 2021):
> Solana is a highly scalable decentralized blockchain developed with a unique method of ordering transactions that significantly improves its transaction throughput, to the point that it has consistently been processing over 2,500 transactions per second. It claims to be able to process 50,000 transactions per second.

## Community
Solana has a community distributed over multiple platforms for example [Twitter](https://twitter.com/solana) and [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/pquxPsq).

## Development
Solana enables developing in Rust.
According to a survey conducted by Stack Overflow, Rust was voted for the top position by developers for four consecutive years.
