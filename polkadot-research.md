# Polkadot Research

## What is Polkadot?

Polkadot is a "multi-chain network" that aims to connect different specialized blockchains into a single unified network. Blockchains that connect with Polkadot work in parallel as so-called “parachains”. This enables them to access the Polkadot network’s proof-of-stake validation of transactions and security. It’s also designed to be fast and scalable. The DOT token is used for staking and governance; it can be bought or sold on Coinbase and other exchanges. 

## What are the costs of using Polkadot?

Average fees that users pay on the network for transactions are less than a dollar

## What about its infrastructure and capabilities?

Polkadot is built using Rust and the Substrate framework. Polkadot provides an infrastructure for blockchains to connect and share security with each other. Relay chain is limited to work around 100 parachains and each has throughput of up to 1500 tps.

## What about developing on Polkadot?

Polkadot has rich documentation and many tools for developing in its ecosystem. There are currently 73 projects being built on Polkadot. Parity Technologies' Substrate modular framework allows developers to select specific components that suit their application-specific chain best and Blockchain explorers for Substrate, Polkadot, Kusama, and other related chains help developers explore the networks. Kusama - a scalable, multichain network for radical innovation, serves as a proving ground that allows teams and developers to build and deploy a parachain, and experiment with Polkadot’s governance and NPoS functionality in a real environment.

## What about Polkadot's Community?

Polkadot is one of the most recognised blockchain projects and there is already a big community building applications on it. However it has received some bad reputation because of some insecurities surrounding the distribution of DOT supplies. 

## What about Polkadot's Future?

Polkadot wants a leading position as a platform to help people build entire blockchains and integrate these blockchains with each other. It is one of the biggest competitors of Ethereum and some people say that it could even surpasses it one day.

## Pros and Cons

Pros:

- Reduced time, energy and money required to build and blockchain
- Parity Technologies' Substrate modular framework offers developers the flexibility to select specific components that best suit their application-specific chain
- Polkadot allows developers to launch chains and applications leveraging a shared security model, without having to worry about attracting enough miners or validators to secure their own chains.
- Polkadot has already raised nearly $200 million, become a top ten coin by market cap, and started to be integrated with other networks, like Chainlink.
  
Cons:
- Long finality times with external blockchains
- Limited number of parachain slots
- In the past two years, hackers have exploited code vulnerabilities and caused millions of dollars of damage before they were discovered.
- Bad reputation for it in the community.
- Competes with Ethereum, Cardano, Cosmos and other which have demonstrated network effects
- Still a work in progress and has a lot to prove

## Conclusion

Polkadot definitely has a spot in the race for the best interoperability solution in the cryptocurrency space. Founded by Gavin Wood, former Co-Founder and CTO of Ethereum, Polkadot's technology addresses the major issues that have stymied blockchain adoption in recent years and it is on the road of building the internet of blockchains of the future. 

## Other notes

- Polkadot wants leading position as a platform to help people build entire blockchains and integrate these blockchains with each other
- Polkadot’s greatest strength is Substrate. This is a development framework for creating Polkadot-compatible blockchains and offers different levels of abstraction depending on developers’ needs. Substrate dramatically reduces the time, energy and money required to create a new blockchain.
- It’s designed to facilitate an Internet where independent blockchains can exchange information and transactions in a trustless way via the Polkadot relay chain.
